function [x_bst, s_bst] = boosting(x_0, objfn, termfn, stepsize)
% Ivar's interpretation of a (perhaps not truly) boosting algorithm.
%
% ARGUMENTS: 
%    x_0       Starting point for the optimization of vector x.
%    objfn     Objective function. Must accept vector x and return a scalar
%    termfn    Termination function. Accepts arguments:
%                     n    Step number of this iteration.
%                     x    The present x being considered.
%                     s    Score as evaluated by objfn(x).
%    stepsize  Size of steps to take when optimizing x.
% 
% RETURNS:
%    x_bst     The best vector x found so far.
%    s_bst     The score of that vector, as evaluated by objfn.
%
% DETAILS:
% Given a starting vector x=x_0, this algorithm samples a step in each
% direction along every dimension in x and moves to that new point 
% if it improves the score according to objective function objfn(x). 
%
% Will terminate whenever @termfn(n,x,s) returns a boolean true value.
%
% Start with as larger step size than you think you need, because the
% algorithm will decrease it as needed to improve fitting.
%
% Returns the best point found and the score of that point. 
%
% TODO:
%    Step size should probably be dhelifferent for each dimension of x or
%    scaling problems could present difficulties. Or, maybe the variance
%    produced by each change should be the scaling factor?
