  Note how siglog is more important than a compressor with fit10. 
  This suggests that fit10 does a better job with the nonlinear elements.

  Points to show:
  - 1 pole or 1 zero insufficient
  - 2 poles, 1 or 2 zeros good enough. 
  - Noise ceiling appears to have been reached. We are equivalent!

* Spectral Reduction
  1. How many spectral vectors are needed?
     Three spectral vectors is enough.
  2. How long a vector do you need?
     30 terms is enough to hit our noise ceiling and start overfitting
