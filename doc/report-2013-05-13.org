#+TITLE: Where do we go from here?

* Questions we have not yet addressed:
** What estimates do we get with a 200Hz envelope stimulus?
   In progress.

** Does jackknifing work better without a) post FIR normalization and b) a NPNL?
   In progress. 

** Run the sp#boost and shboo# fitters again without NPNLs (nonl)
   In progress

** Should we drop first second of stimuli to improve stationarity?
   Not a bad idea. Let's call it env100d1s (for drop 1 sec).

** Better searching/sorting of semi-arbitrary keyword 
   
* Things to tackle next:
  1. Make it so my edits don't mess up queued work
  2. Do a code review of shboo3

* Questions we have asked and answered
** What is best compressor?
   log2b. But maybe that has changed!

** Is MSE picking up the MSES tokens during the cumulative curve plots?
   No. But it will pick up extra tokens if you aren't careful about locking down all the other 'hold' tokens.
