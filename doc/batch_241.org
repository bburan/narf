  3. Do FIR coefs change when trained per-respfile?

     The FIR coefs are too noisy for my eyeball to pick out any reliable differences.
 
* If I had to make any conclusions, I would say...
  1. ...that some cells are inhibited during active behaviors, decreasing their spike count. This in turn makes fits more difficult and produces lower r_test values.
  2. ...that some cells have their gain changed during active behaviors. Three had gains that increased, and two had gains that decreased.
  3. ...that training the FIR coefs separately for each respfile wasn't actually a very useful thing because it's so hard to know if two FIRs are different because of a scientific reason instead of just random fitting noise.

* Issues that need to be considered:
  1. The total number of spikes in each behavior respfile should be displayed?

* Boosting per file beats boosting?
