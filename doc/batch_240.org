#+author: Ivar Thorson, Brian Jones
* Overview

  The goal of this experiment is to answer the following questions:
  1. Which of the many nonparametric nonlinearities is performing the best on average?
  2. Which of the many fitters is performing the best on average?
  3. Which of the sparseness penalties are performing the best on average?
  4. Are there any mitigating qualitative factors that need to be considered?
  5. For Batch #240 (Center/Surround), are there a few categories of patterns we can discern when observing best FIR filter coefficients?
  6. For Batch #242 (Left/Right), are there a few categories of patterns we can discern when observing best FIR filter coefficients?

* Model structure
** Loader
** 
** Compressor
    1. *log2b*: log2 with baseline so that the output is positive semidefinite.
** FIR Filter 
    1. *firn*: Normalization on inputs, normalization on output.
** Nonlinearity
    1. *npnl*: Ye olde "classic" standard, fast to compute and very good except for edges.
    2. *npfnl*: Gaussian window filter npnl with filter widths equal to 1/5th of nonlinearity's input domain span. Relatively untested.
    3. *npfnl3*: Gaussian window filter npnl three deviations wide. Relatively untested. 
    4. *senl*: Sparse gaussian mixture model which uses a small number of 1d gaussians (0.2 relative width) centered at 'representative' data points.
    5. *senl3*: Sparse gaussian mixture model with slightly wider gaussians (0.3 relative width).
    6. *gmm4*: Gaussian mixture model which uses four expectation-maximized 2D gaussians to create a nonparametric nonlinearity. 
** Fitters
    1. *fmin*: Basic line search built in to matlab called fminsearch(), iterated 10000 times or until convergence.
    2. *fminlsq*: First an fminsearch(), followed by lsqcurvefit(), iterated ??? times or until convergence.
    3. *boost*: A simple boosting implementation. 200 steps taken.
    4. *sb*: Sparse bayesian boosting. Kind of like nonlinear gradient descent, but with sparse steps that only go in some directions. 200 steps taken.
** Performance metrics
    1. *mse*  : Performance metric is mean squared error, with no smoothness or sparseness penalty.
    2. *mses2*: Same as MSE, but a sparseness penalty of 10^-2. (Strong sparseness penalty)
    3. *mses3*: Same as MSE, but a sparseness penalty of 10^-3. 
    4. *mses4*: Same as MSE, but a sparseness penalty of 10^-4. 
    5. *mses5*: Same as MSE, but a sparseness penalty of 10^-5. 
    6. *mses6*: Same as MSE, but a sparseness penalty of 10^-6. (Weak sparseness penalty)

* BATCH 240 EYEBALL CHECK:
  Checklist for each cell:
  1. Does the training set equal the test set? Discard as invalid if so.
  2. Is the complete row filled out on the heat map?
  3. Scatter plot tok4: is there a dominating nonlinearity?
  4. Scatter plot tok5: is there a dominating fitter?

  When evaluating FIR filters:
  - Penalize noise and appearance
  - Penalize large coefficients scattered around 'randomly'
  - Penalize non-sparse things
  - Penalize slightly large coefficients in first time bin, strongly if in last time bin
  
  Possible stereotypes:
  - Single channel interest only
  - Inhibition/excitation
  - Offset inhibition/excitation
  - Which channel is being excited
