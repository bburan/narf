* 200Hz Experiments on Batch 179 using Continuous Linear Filters
** Experiment 0: Which linear filter gives us the best bang for our buck?
   p1z0 is pretty good. 
   p3z2 is better.
   p1z0x3 is best. Something about adding three "directions" is really nice. 

** Experiment 1: Which are the best nonlinearities to pair
   Compressors: {'null', 'exp', 'logfree', 'rootfree', 'zthresh'}
   Nonlinearities:  {'null', 'siglog', 'siglog100', 'zthresh', 'zsoft', 'npfnl0'}
   Fitter: fit04a    (Starts at stepsize of 100, bisection search, until a single step is forced on each coefficient. Iterative.)  
   Compressor: logfree
   Nonlinearity: npfnl0, followed by siglog

** Observations:
  1. Siglog100 doesn't work well after a normalization. Probably it is optimized for SVD's code. 
  2. depct1_siglog100 beats fir_siglog almost always. However, it loses to fir_npfnl0 occasionally enough that it suggests fitting could be improved.
  3. nim would probably exactly meet or slightly exceed fir_npfnl0 if there weren't a few really bad outliers for which NIM fails. 
  4. p1z0x3 slightly beats fir. When there is an npfnl0 appended, FIR slightly wins. 
  5. abcdv2_npfnl0 vs fir_npfnl0
  6. fast3slow1_npfnl0 vs p1z0x3: Scatterplot suggests that although fast3slow1 has lower mean, it's a better model (excluding outliers)
  7. fir_npfnl0
  8. Siglog fits are pretty loose and look like they need to be fit "harder". Maybe down to 10^-6?

** How many parameters does each model have?
   For batch 179, the number of parameters and average correlation for each model are:
   | Params | R | Model                                         |
   |--------+---+-----------------------------------------------|
   |      5 |   | logfree_p1z0                                  |
   |      8 |   | logfree_p1z0x2                                |
   |     11 |   | logfree_p1z0x3                                |
   |        |   | logfree_abcdv2                                |
   |        |   | logfree_fast3slow1                            |
   |     19 |   | logfree_fir_siglog_fit05                      |
   |     22 |   | logfree_depct1_siglog100_fit05                |
   |    163 |   | NIM = 2*(30 FIR, 25x2 NL) + 3 for spiking NL) |

** Things that should be tried
   1. A comparison between adding slow exponential kernel as a 'leaky, suppressive integrator' vs using a depression filter.
   3. Adding a sigmoid to the end that is more tightly fit
   4. Replicating NIM with p1z0 filters and FIR filters

* Opinion
  My hunch is that the big discovery of NIM (Two curves, one with "delayed inhibition") is just some depression effect being aliased into the linear model somehow.
  My testable prediction bet if we explicitly include depression of the right type, it will largely disappear. 
  On the other hand, I also bet that using multiple filters + thresholding is the real discovery.
  Probably the more simple filters and simple thresholds you use, the better.
