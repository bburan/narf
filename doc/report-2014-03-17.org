* Using fit05, GT12, Compressor and NL
  - A1: No significant difference between channels or FIR
  - PPF: WC04>WC03>W02>WC01 
  - PEG: No significant difference between channels, but WC3,4 > FIR
  - Depression helps significantly always
  - IFN helps, but is not significant

* Using fit10, GT12, Compressor and NL
  - A1: No significant difference between channels, but WC3,4 > FIR. 
  - PPF: WC02,3 win significantly.
  - PEG: No significant difference between channels, but WC02,3,4>FIR. Unusually, depression HURTS
  - WC always helps
  
* Using fit10, GT36, 200Hz, No compressor or NL for WC comparisons
  - A1:  WC02,3 > WC01. WC01 worse than FIR. 
  - PPF: WC03 > w01. 
  - PEG: No significant difference between channels, but all beat FIR.

* Using fit10, GT36, 200Hz, CP and NL, but on Batch 246
  - A1: No significant difference between channels

* Best guesses:
  - A1: 1 channel is enough if you have a compressor and NL.
  - PPF: 3 channels is needed, even if you have a compressor and NL.
  - PEG: 1 channel is enough, if you have a compressor and NL. 
  - Depression usually helps (except PEG fit10 WC03 GT12)
  - IFN helps but only barely significant with fit10 and >50 neurons

* Other notes
  - Multiplicative champ: env200_logfree_voltq_wc02a_fir30_siglog_fit10
  - Weighting: wc01a beats wc01, suggesting initalization helps
