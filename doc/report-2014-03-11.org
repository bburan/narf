* Status Report for 2014-03-11
** (#1) Fitters
   Fit10 is the current winner.
   - [ ] Try single-dim Conjugate gradient descent
   - [ ] Try multiple-dim conjugate gradient descent
   - [ ] Try Variance-normalized boosting steps
** (#2) Compressors
   Sigumber/sigcauchy/sigell are winning, but logfree/dlog are cheaper.
   - [ ] Try Per-channel compressors
** (#3) Linear Filters
   p4z4 is the winner. But p2z2 does very well and is cheaper.
   - [ ] Try combining WC and p2z2?
** (#5) Nonlinearities
   Siglog100 wins. But sigrich does very well and is cheaper.
   - [ ] Better sigrich initialization?
** (#6) Multiplicative
   Voltq_logfree/logfree_voltq wins. But it expands from 2 to 5 chans. 
   - [ ] Try a factorized version that doesn't increase channel count. 
** (#8) Statefulness
   dep1pc is winner. But we should try:
   - [ ] Facilitation via leaky integration
   - [ ] Push-Pull gain-control
** (#11) Weighted Channels
   Unclear for 246!!! I guess WC02, but this needs work
   - [ ] 
** (#??) Per-Chan Compressors, NLs
   Not yet implemented. 
   - [ ] Generalize NL module to allow per-chan Compressors, NLs.
** (#??) Metrics
   We need more metrics. 
   - [ ] Log likelihood (gaussian)
   - [ ] Log-likelihood (point process)
   - [ ] NMSE with a "maximum"

** Conclusions
  - New Best Guess: logfree_wc02_voltq_dep1pc_p2z2_sigrich_fit10
