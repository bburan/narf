function newsig = conv_fn(signal, dim, fn, nwin, novl)
% CONV_FN: A function-application-based convolution along 1 dimension.
% It should work for up to 4 dimensional SIGNAL matrices.
%
% OPERATION:
%  Input SIGNAL is grouped into NWIN-element long chunks along dimension
% DIM. Then NOVL elements groups are padded to the front and back of each
% chunk. If no such elements exist (such as at the beginning and end of
% SIGNAL), they will not be included in the chunk, so chunk length varies.
% 
% By this point, the chunk should have at most NOVL + NWIN + NOVL elements.
% This chunk is then passed to FN, which should be a function which accepts
% a vector. Useful picks for FN are @sum, @mean, or @max, corresponding to
% the L1, L2, and Linfty norms, but almost any function that accepts
% vectors should work.
%
% FN is executed as many times as there are chunks, and the return values 
% of FN are bundled together the convolution is returned. 
%
% If you set N to 1, you can create a windowed FIR response that is
% as nonlinear or arbitrary as you want, which can be useful. If you set it
% to 10 and use FN=@max, you are finding the maximum over each window. 
%
% INPUTS:
%      SIGNAL    A 1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D matrix.
%      DIM       The dimension along which to apply the convolution.
%      FN        The function to apply during the downsampling. 
%                It should accept a vector and return a scalar.
%      NWIN      The number of elements of SIGNAL to bundle together.
%                Choose 10 to 'resample' 50Hz signal and make it 5Hz.
%      NOVP      The number of elements before and after the current point
%                to to overlap. Set to 0 if you don't want overlapping. 
%                Setting it to NWIN/2 will double the size of vectors
%                passed to FN. (The length would be NWIN/2 + NWIN + NWIN/2)
% 
% OUTPUTS:
%      NEWSIG    The transformed SIGNAL matrix. 
%
% EXAMPLE:
%      x = rand([3,1000,2]);             % Create a random matrix
%      y1 = conv_fn(x, 2, @sum, 10, 5);  % Sum together groups of ten elements plus five on each side
%      hist(y1(1,:,1));                  % If a gaussian appears, you just demonstrated the central limit theorem.
%      plot(y1(1,2:end,1), y1(1,1:end-1,1), 'k.');  % Any groupings that appear demonstrate that nonzero NOVL resulted in each element correlating somewhat with the previous element
%      corrcoef(y1(1,2:end,1), y1(1,1:end-1,1));    % A correlation coefficient analysis confirms this statement
