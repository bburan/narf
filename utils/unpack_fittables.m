function unpack_fittables(w)
% unpack_fittables(w, only_these_split_indexes)
%
% Given a weight wector w, this function fills up the current fields marked
% in the STACK as being fittable with the values from w. It is the opposite
% action to pack_fittables(). 
%
% ARGUMENTS:
%    w       A weight vector as created by pack_fittables().
%
% RETURNS: Nothing
